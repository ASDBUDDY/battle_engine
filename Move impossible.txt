These are moves that require the engine to take into account changes to the entire field and how the battle is played.

The recharge mechanism isn't implemented in the engine yet (so far only charge up is). These are moves that will medium difficulty once the first Recharge effect is implemented:

Hyper Beam
Frenzy Plant
Blast Burn
Hydro Cannon
Giga Impact
Rock Wrecker
Roar of Time
Prismatic Laster


Protection based moves aren't implemented yet, and as such any moves that break protection can't be implemented yet either. Once protection is implemented, most of these moves will move to medium - maybe even easy depending on the implementation.

Protect
Detect
Endure
Feint
Wide Guard
Mat Block
Phantom Force
Crafy Shield
King's Shield
Hyperspace Hole
Spiky Shield
Baneful Bunker
Shadow Force


Abilities for Pokemon need to be revisted and revamped. They were made before moves and the engine has changed too much to use the older code. I will revamp the abilities and their callback system. After that these moves can be implemented:

Role Play
Skill Swap
Gastroo Acid
Worryseed
Simple Beam
Core Enforcer
Sunsteel Strike
Moongeist Beam
Entrainment


Items aren't implemented yet. So moves using items won't be doable until items are done. Such moves are:

Multi-attack (Dependant on item)
Belch
Techno Blast (item)
Bestow (Item)
Bug Bite
Judgement
Embargo
Fling
Pluck
Natural Gift
Snatch
Knock Off
Covet
Recycle
Theif
Trick
Switcheroo


These are moves which change Pokemon Type. Some code is still reading from the party Pokemon directly instead of the p_bank struct. Once this is updated, these moves will become possible:

Conversion
Conversion 2
Reflect Types
Soak
Flying Press
Trick-or-Treat
Ion Deluge
Forest's Curse
Electrify
Burn up(type change)


Moves that can't be done until Switching is completed:

Baton Pass
Memento
U-turn
Healing Wish
Volt Switch
Fairy Lock (Switch in prevention)
Thousand Waves (Switching)
Spirit Shackle (switching)
Anchor Shot (switching)

Moves that won't be done until much much later:
Z-moves
